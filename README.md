# Pet-Rekognition-Challenger

This repo will be a collection of ML models focusing on image processing and classification.
The first implemented model will be the VGG-16.
The directory included does not include any dataset; it only serves as a template directory to add images to the train and validation. 
The project name Pet-Rekognition is from the repo made by Adrian Cantrill: "aws-pet-rekognition-ecr" 
https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs/tree/master/aws-pet-rekognition-ecr

The main branch will have the models as is with little modifications to parameters.
The develop branch will be used for Fine Tuning the models as well as experimenting.
